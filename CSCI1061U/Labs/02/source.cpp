// You are required to write a C++ program that would serve as a word count. Word count is used quite 
// a lot in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and is pretty interesting concept that is used in various 
// applications today like spam detection, sentiment analysis and etc.
// You are provided a text file (data.txt) with this lab which is an excerpt from Ontario Tech Universityâ€™s 
// history. All the punctuations except the apostrophe are intentionally removed from the text. You are 

// required to perform the following tasks:
// - Read the text file word by word.
// - Create a class called WordCounter that 
// - Has 2 data members, e.g., string word, int count.
// - Has appropriate getters and setters
// - At least one constructor
// - Uses this keyword to help distinguish between data members and local variables
// - Create a collection of words in such a way that your program can distinguish between different 
//   words, e.g., store each different word in an object of WordCounter class.
// - Every time a word appears your program is required to count the occurrence of that word in 
//   the file.
// - Finally print a report with each word and number of times it occurred in the text file provided.
// - You can only use #include<iostream>, #include<fstream>, #include<string>, include<vector> 
//   libraries.
// 
// Your program should at least have the following methods:
// - bool isFound(vector<WordCounter> &v, string word) which takes a vector of WordCounter objects 
//   and a word to make a search of that word in that vector. If the word is found, return true else 
//   false.
// - void  incrementWordCount(????)  function  that  counts  the  occurrences  of  the  word.  It  is  your 
//   responsibility to find out which arguments should be provided to this function.
// - void  printReport(vector<WordCounter>  &v)  which  should  simply  have  a  cout  statement  that  tells 
//   how many times a word has appeared in the file.
